# Net Munge

Munge your neural networks to make them smaller and maybe sometimes faster! May
change the accuracy of the model, and using heuristics may not help performance
for all networks.

## Offered methods

* Compressing floating point values to lower precision floats

## Future Work

Here lists any papers or works which I may want to apply in future.

* [An Survey of Neural Network Compression - James T. Oâ€™ Neill ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03669.pdf)
